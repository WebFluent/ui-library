## Modal

Some general description about modals.

- [Primary](#primary)
- [Custom](#customize)

<br />

## Usage

<br />

### Basic

The modal in its most basic form takes in a `isOpen` boolean flag to control the open state of the modal and a `close` function to set the `isOpen` state to false. 
It also takes in `children` and renders it in the modal container.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Customize

You can completely customize the modal by passing in styled components through props to overide core components of the modal. Here is a list of the core components that are interchangable.

<ul>
  <li>Backdrop</li>
  <li>CloseButton</li>
  <li>Container</li>
</ul>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-modal--custom" />
</Canvas>
