# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories. 

For example:

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Small](#small)

### Primary

### Secondary

<Story id="components-button--secondary" />

### Large

<Story id="components-button--large" />

### Medium

<Story id="components-button--medium" />

### Small
