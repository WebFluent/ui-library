# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories. 

For example:

import { Story, Canvas } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary](#primary)
- [Secondary](#secondary)
- [Large](#large)
- [Small](#small)

### Primary

  <Story id="components-button--primary" />

</Canvas>

### Medium
